<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h3>My favorite hikes in Alaska...</h3>
<p>Literally all of them are my favorite... <br>
    Everytime we go, I am just blown away by how spectacular Alaska really is.
<br>I always want to just hike my little heart out, and am never disappointed, just cold. <br>
Also, Bear Spray is a must. The last time we went, we saw bear scat on a few of the trails back... at dusk...and I was FREAKING out. 
<br> If bears are anything like sharks, dusk is their time to shine. 
<br> And unlike sharks, bears don't stay in the water. 
   <br>  My husband is from Alaska, so he was totally calm and composed. Meanwhile, I had no chill.
 Here are the top hikes that come to mind:</p>
<ol><li>Crow Pass</li>
    <li>Reed Lakes</li>
    <li>Gold Mint Trail</li> 
    <li>Any Glacier</li> 
    <li>Literally just stop on the road and look around and it's beautiful</li>
</ol>
